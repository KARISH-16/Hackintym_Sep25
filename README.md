## Smart Food Cycle

<!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
Every year, tons of food is wasted while many communities face hunger.  
The challenge is to build a **smart donation and planning platform** that reduces food waste, redistributes excess food, and promotes sustainability through AI-powered planning and fertilizer reuse.  

**Smart Food Cycle** is a community-driven web platform to:  
* Collect leftover food and deliver it to those in need.  
* Use **AI-powered meal planning** to suggest recipes and calculate portions.  
* Convert food waste into **fertilizer** for sustainable gardening.  
* Register beneficiaries for food or fertilizer assistance.  

The vision is simple: **Reduce Waste → Feed Communities → Sustain Nature.**

✅ **Donate Extra Food** – Users can donate food from homes, events, and canteens.  
✅ **Book Volunteers** – Volunteers pick up donations and deliver them to shelters/orphanages.  
✅ **AI Food Planner** – Suggests recipes, calculates food quantities, and adjusts meals by weather, people, and budget.  
✅ **Fertilizer Redistribution** – Sends food waste to gardeners/farmers for compost/fertilizer.  
✅ **Beneficiary Registration** – NGOs and individuals can register to receive support.  
✅ **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop and mobile with smooth animations.  

Built With: 
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**  
- **Google Fonts – Roboto**  
- **Icons – Icons8 & free assets**  

Usage

👩‍🍳 Donors – Submit donation details (name, location, food type, quantity).
🚴 Volunteers – Get assigned to pick up food and deliver it to registered NGOs.
🤖 AI Planner –

Input leftover food, people count, weather, and budget.
